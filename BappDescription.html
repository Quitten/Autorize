<p>
    Autorize is an automatic authorization and authentication enforcement detection extension that identifies access
    control vulnerabilities in web applications. It monitors traffic from a high-privileged user, automatically replays
    those requests with low-privileged or unauthenticated credentials, and analyzes responses to detect authorization
    bypasses and authentication weaknesses.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Automatic detection of authorization and authentication enforcement issues by replaying requests with different
        privilege levels</li>
    <li>Support for multiple low-privileged users with independent enforcement detection and match/replace rules</li>
    <li>Configurable enforcement detection using status codes, response headers, body content, regex patterns, and
        response length</li>
    <li>Flexible interception filters based on scope, URL patterns, HTTP methods, request/response headers and body
        content</li>
    <li>Visual status indicators showing whether authorization is bypassed, enforced, or requires manual configuration
    </li>
    <li>HTML and CSV export for reporting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Autorize tab and open the Configuration section</li>
    <li>Add low-privileged user credentials by specifying authorization headers or cookies that will be injected into
        replayed requests</li>
    <li>Optionally configure enforcement detectors to define custom rules for identifying when authorization is properly
        enforced</li>
    <li>Set up interception filters to control which requests should be tested (e.g., scope-only, URL patterns, HTTP
        methods)</li>
    <li>Browse the application as a high-privileged user. The extension
        automatically repeats every request with the session of the low privileged user and detects authorization
        vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Review the results table where each request shows enforcement status: Bypassed (red), Enforced (green), or
        uncertain (yellow)</li>
    <li>Select any entry to compare the original response with the modified low-privileged and unauthenticated responses
    </li>
    <li>For uncertain results, configure enforcement detectors with specific patterns that indicate proper authorization
        enforcement</li>
</ol>
